# Leads Tracker


## Project Overview

Leads Tracker is a simple web application that allows users to input and save leads (e.g., URLs, contacts, or any text). The leads are displayed in an unordered list on the webpage. Users can add new inputs through a text field and a save button, and the saved leads will be displayed dynamically.

    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

    ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the application.

## Usage

- Enter a lead (text) into the input field.
- Click the "SAVE INPUT" button.
- The saved lead will appear in the unordered list below the input field.
